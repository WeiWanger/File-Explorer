# File-Explorer 
This is an application that I learned from a YouTube channel
It is a pretty good practice for beginner who just jumped into the JavaScript & React. 
The App shows the method to create a folder explorer, which is same to the file explorer in Windows. I think this simple project is a good interview question 
taht often asked by the Google, Amazon, etc. I'm not really sure!
